### Space-Hell

ABANDONED PROJECT

It was my first game so ignore the horrible organization.

## Overview
A bullet hell that's basically Touhou but in space and requires aiming.

There's a story mode but it's pretty bad.

There's also a stage builder for creating and sharing custom stages. It actually works, but it's not very user-friendly.

The game's focus is mostly on the boss rush mode. Each boss is actually pretty cool since they were designed to have aesthetic attack patterns and just look sick in general. The game's attempt at a "unique factor" is that bullets from enemies can do stuff like explode into more bullets, bounce off the play area's edges, start orbiting a position, explode into bullets that explode into even more bullets, do any combination of those things, and more.
